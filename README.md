# Wine Quality Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset used in this project contains several features that describe the chemical composition of different wine samples, and the target variable is the quality of the wine.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (Target variable)

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Data normalization
   - Feature selection
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of features
   - Identifying correlations between features and the target variable
   - Visualizing the data using various plots

3. **Model Building**:
   - Training multiple classification models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Comparing the performance of different models
   - Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics
   - Fine-tuning the selected model for optimal performance

## Results

The results section will include:
- Performance metrics for each model
- Confusion matrix for the best-performing model
- ROC curve and AUC score for the best-performing model
- Feature importance analysis

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the project, including the performance of the selected model and its ability to accurately predict wine quality. Discuss any limitations and potential improvements for future work.
